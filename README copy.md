# CIS*4030 ‚Äì Mobile Computing ‚Äì Project Milestone 02 (M02) Specification  

This project will have you build and demonstrate your mobile app development expertise by having you develop an app, with the goal of having it releasable on the Google and Apple app stores. It is not required that you actually release the app, but your final app should be sufficiently complete to allow its release.  

---

## Groups
Now that you have all formed groups, please make sure that you are in the correct group on CourseLink.  

Group work requires that all group members engage and contribute to the group project. We expect you all to act professionally. We will rebalance grades within a group if we are provided with documentation showing a clear lack of contribution from a member. We will also examine your repos to make sure commits are spread across all group members.  

---

## Access
- You must use a SoCS GitLab repo for your project (available free to all students).  
- You should all have access to your repos now and see that the instructional team also has access.  
- Assuming all group members agree, you can make your project public after the course by cloning it to a persistent repo.  

**You must use Flutter for your project.**

## üíª M02 Code

‚úÖ Cosmetic changes (e.g., comments, improved structure) made after your video is fine, but drastic differences will result in lost marks.  

### Grading Criteria:

- Clear and **maintainable code structure**.  
- Completeness of the **implemented interface**.
